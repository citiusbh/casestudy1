The project involves setting up a multi-environment deployment pipeline for a containerized web application using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure DevOps. The goal is to automate the deployment process across three environments: Development (Dev), Testing (Test), and Production (Prod). This ensures a smooth and consistent deployment workflow, enhancing the application's reliability and scalability.

Steps and Explanations
Created a new project in Azure DevOps.
Initialized a Git repository to store the application code, Dockerfile, and pipeline configurations.
To automate the building and packaging of the application. i   build pipeline in Azure DevOps using a azure-pipelines.yml file pipeline will be triggered when there are changes in the main branch of the repository.
The vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest' means that the pipeline will use the latest Ubuntu virtual machine image.
The pipeline triggers on changes to the main branch.
It uses an Ubuntu VM image to run the tasks.
It sets a variable for the Docker image name.
It packages the project using Maven.
It builds and pushes a Docker image to the container registry, tagging it with the build ID.
