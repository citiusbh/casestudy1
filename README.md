Case Study-1

Problem Statement: You have been tasked with setting up a multi-environment deployment pipeline for a web application running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The web application is a containerized application built using Docker and stored in a Git repository. The application needs to be deployed automatically to multiple AKS environments (dev, test, and prod) whenever changes are made to the code. You are expected to use Azure DevOps, a service principal, and a managed identity for this task.

Steps to complete the assignment:

1. Create an Azure DevOps project and repository:
2. Create a build pipeline
3. Create a service principal
4. Create a managed identity
5. Create a release pipeline
6. Configure continuous integration: 
7. Configure continuous deployment: 
8. Set up variables and secrets: 
9. Set up environment variables
10. Add approval gates
11. Configure monitoring 
12. Set up alerts

Sample web application code: Java SpringBoot Microservice Code
Skills - set up a multi-environment deployment pipeline using Azure DevOps and AKS, using both a service principal and a managed identity for secure deployment
